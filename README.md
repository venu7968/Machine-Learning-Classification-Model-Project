# Machine-Learning-Classification-Model-Project
Developed a machine learning classification model to predict rainfall for The Daily Buzz newspaper’s “Weather Oracle” column in Sydney. 
Utilized data from 2008 to 2017, performing extensive preprocessing, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming features such as temperature, humidity, and cloud cover. 
Implemented and compared multiple classification models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting, selecting the most accurate model based on metrics such as accuracy score and confusion matrix. The model enhanced prediction accuracy, supporting informed weather-based editorial content and audience engagement.
